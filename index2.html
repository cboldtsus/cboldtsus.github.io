        <p>I am a Senior at York Tech in Computer Programming; I am learning rapidly in JavaScript and actively working on a Blackjack game using that code language. I have worked at the Mr Q's skating rink right up until it unfortunately burned down. I am now currently working at Spirit Halloween. I plan on going to college for Physics Astronomy. I have applied to Kutztown university as of date. While in high school this year, i am in dual enrollment at HACC, earning extra college credits before going to a university. I am learning guitar at a slow pace but i have been enjoying it. But that is all for now, thank you for taking your time to read this !</p>
